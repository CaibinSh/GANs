# Evaluation GAN

## Inception Score

Want to know more about why Fréchet Inception Distance has overtaken Inception Score? This paper illustrates the problems with using Inception Score.

## HYPE

Intrigued about human evaluation and HYPE (Human eYe Perceptual Evaluation) of GANs? Learn more about this human benchmark in the paper! You may notice a familiar name among the authors ;)

## Precision and Recall

Using precision and recall metrics on GANs pique your interest? See some specific methods in this paper! Note that you will learn all about StyleGAN in Week 3 of this course.
