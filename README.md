This repository contains codes and materials during learning GANs from Deeplearning.AI. It is only for learning purpose.

This specilization covers many advanced generative models, such as GAN, DCGAN, styleGAN, CycleGAN and etc. I re-write some of them using Pytorch-lightning and refactor them to enable reusablility. 

All original assignments were removed to avoid violation of policies of Coursera.
