## Transposed convolutions

Now that you have an idea of what transposed convolutions are (also commonly referred to as "deconvolutions") and the checkerboard pattern problem that comes with using them, let's take a closer look! This interactive paper demonstrates the checkerboard pattern problem and how they are not exclusive to GANs, but any neural network that employs them.

## GANs for vedio

In this [notebook](C1W2_Video_Generation_Optional.ipynb), you're going to learn about TGAN, from the paper Temporal Generative Adversarial Nets with Singular Value Clipping (Saito, Matsumoto, & Saito, 2017), and its origins in image generation.
