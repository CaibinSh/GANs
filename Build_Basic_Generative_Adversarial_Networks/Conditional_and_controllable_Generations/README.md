# Conditional & controllable GANs

## InfoGAN

In this [notebook](C1W4_InfoGAN.ipynb), you're going to learn about InfoGAN in order to generate disentangled outputs, based on the paper, InfoGAN: Interpretable Representation Learning by Information Maximizing Generative Adversarial Nets by Chen et. al. While there are many approaches to disentanglement, this is one of the more widely used and better known.

## Conditional GAN

Paper: [Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets](ConditionalGAN.pdf) (Mirza and Osindero, 2014)

[Assginment -- conditional GAN](C1W4A_Build_a_Conditional_GAN.ipynb).  

[PyTorch-lightning version](../../gans/models/CGAN/) and [re-implementation of the assignment](myC1W4A_Conditional_GAN.ipynb)

## Controllable GAN

Paper: [Interpreting the Latent Space of GANs for Semantic Face Editing](ControllableGAN.pdf) (Shen, Gu, Tang, and Zhou, 2020)  

[Assginment -- controllable GAN](C1W4B_Controllable_Generation.ipynb).
